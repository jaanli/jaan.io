I'm a Postdoctoral Officer of Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center focused on machine learning methods for health and science. I work with [Noémie Elhadad](http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/noemie/).

For my Ph.D., I was fortunate to be advised by [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/) and [Shivaji Sondhi](http://www.princeton.edu/~sondhi/).  My work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and I had fun working with [Andriy Mnih](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amnih/) at [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com/), and [Eugene Brevdo](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~ebrevdo/) at [Google Brain](https://research.google.com/). Previously, I studied Maths and Physics at McGill. Find my CV at [jaan.io/cv](https://jaan.io/cv).

I'm Estonian-Canadian and outside of academia I love volleyball, meditation, [music production](https://soundcloud.com/lyfos), and George Saunders. 

How can we use technology such as machine learning to effect the most societal good? This is what motivates me. A few years ago, I launched [Useful Science](http://usefulscience.org) with a group of friends – I hope you'll find a study on there that improves your life.
