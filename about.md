I'm a Physics PhD student at Princeton doing research at the intersection of Bayesian inference and deep learning. I am fortunate to be advised by [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/) and [Shivaji Sondhi](http://www.princeton.edu/~sondhi/). 

My work is supported by an NSERC Postgraduate Scholarship. In 2015 I had lots of fun doing research with [Andriy Mnih](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amnih/) at [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com/), and in 2016 I collaborated with [Eugene Brevdo](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~ebrevdo/) at [Google Brain](https://research.google.com/).

Find my CV at [jaan.io/cv](https://jaan.io/cv). In short: when it comes to Big Data, I live, breathe, and eat it. Crunchy crispy models are my bread and butter, lunch, and mother.

I'm Estonian-Canadian and graduated from McGill in 2013. Outside of academia, I love volleyball, meditation, [music production](https://soundcloud.com/lyfos), and George Saunders. 

How can we use technology such as machine learning to effect the most societal good? This is what motivates me. In 2014, I launched [Useful Science](http://usefulscience.org) with a group of friends – I hope you'll find a study on there that improves your life.

### Colophon

Hey! Having a 'colophon' doesn't mean I'm a jerk! Just wanted to thank [Cole Townsend](http://coletownsend.com/) for letting me fork his Jekyll theme – the code is available [here](https://github.com/altosaar/jaan.io) :)
