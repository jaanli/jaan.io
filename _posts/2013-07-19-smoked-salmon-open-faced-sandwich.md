This sandwich is an all-time classic hall-of-famer mainstay in my family. It's a classy breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and is great for hosting (guests can make their own sandwiches). Just brush your teeth after consumption.

###Ingredients

* White bread with sesame seeds, well-toasted
* Unsalted butter
* Fresh smoked salmon, sliced [[^1]]
* Lemon
* Capers or thinly sliced caperberries
* Green onions (shallots or white onions are good substitutes)
* Olive oil
* Sea salt flakes
* Freshly ground pepper

###Instructions
Toast the bread. Finely dice the shallots, onions, or green onions.

Liberally butter the toasted bread, and cover the entirety of the toast's surface with a single layer of smoked salmon. Sprinkle the sheet of salmon with lemon juice.

Evenly cover with the diced shallots and capers in about a 3:1 ratio of onions to capers.

Pour a decent amount (about 1 tablespoon) of olive oil onto the sandwich. Scatter sea salt flakes and finish it with some ground pepper.

This is easiest to eat with knife and fork due to the olive oil overdose. Serve with a glass of wine or whole milk, depending on time of day.

[^1]: Aim to buy fresh 'chunk' sushi-grade smoked salmon (ideally, never frozen) from your local fishmonger. Slice it with a sharp knife to your preferred thickness. This allows you to achiveve thinner slices than the pre-sliced smoked salmon from normal grocery stores.
